# MotionDetectionVideoEditor

# Project Overview
Motion Detection Video Editor is a Python-based tool that analyzes videos for motion, generates a graph of the most active segments, and then compiles these segments into a new video. This tool is ideal for creating highlights or summaries from longer video footage by focusing on the parts with the most activity.

# Features
Motion Detection: Analyzes videos frame by frame to detect motion.
#Graph Generation: Creates a graph showing motion intensity over time for each video.
Video Compilation: Compiles the segments with the highest motion into a single video.
Customizable Output: Allows specification of the desired total duration for the final compiled video.

# Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
OpenCV-Python
MoviePy
NumPy
Matplotlib
